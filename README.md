=== Description ===

Some commands for Sublime Text 3 (NOT 2!) to list shortcut keys / preferences

## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
    ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings – User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
    ],
    ```
1. And,
    change it to the following, i.e.,
    put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
    ],
    ```
    * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
      you will not install this forked version of the package,
      but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
    > [!WARNING]
    > Placing this custom channel before the default channel changes Package Control's resolution globally. Packages from this channel with the same name will override versions from the default channel.
    >
    > You can review the channel contents here:
    > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
1. Now,
    go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    search for **`EditPreferences`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

=== How to insert a binding repr in the Quick Panel ===

Copy from the Default.sublime-keymap.template the last line that contains a
multitude of bindings with `insert_binding_repr` and place it in your User
keymap.


So how would you insert alt+q? You can think of it like this:

    * PRESS `alt` and hold it down
    * PRESS `=` while thinking PLUS then lift all fingers
    * PRESS `q`

Note that on a standard US keyboard `=` is on the same key as `+` (plus)  You
can't bind to just a modifier like alt, so plus seems a resaonable key/mnemonic.

In sublime `{"keys": [...]}` terms previous exmaple would be:

    * PRESS `["alt+="]`
    * PRESS `["q"]`

The following bindings show how it works.
Note the `expecting_binding_repr_mode` key.

```js
    {"args": {"val": "alt"},
     "command": "insert_binding_repr",
     "context": [{"key": "overlay_visible", "operand": true, "operator": "equal"},
                 {"key": "setting.expecting_binding_repr_mode",
                  "operand": false,
                  "operator": "equal"}],
     "keys": ["alt+="]}
```

```js
     {"args": {"val": "q"},
      "command": "insert_binding_repr",
      "context": [{"key": "overlay_visible", "operand": true, "operator": "equal"},
                  {"key": "setting.expecting_binding_repr_mode",
                   "operand": true,
                   "operator": "equal"}],
      "keys": ["q"]}
```

So how would you insert ctrl+alt+q? (In sublime terms)

    * PRESS `ctrl+alt+=`
    * PRESS `q`

=== Help? You can't insert_binding_repr for down|enter|up ? ===

Unfortunately, some bindings don't work as the second key due to the quickpanel
swallowing them:

    * <enter>
    * <up>
    * <down>
    * and others ...

The workaround is to type the first letter of the key you desire, eg:

    * type `e` for <enter> to insert `alt+e` then type `nter`
    * type `u` for <up> to insert `alt+u` then type `p`
    * type `d` for <down>  to insert `alt+d` then type `own`
